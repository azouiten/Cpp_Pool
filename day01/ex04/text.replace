blob_the_fish was an ugly creature living in the depths of the sea, one day blob_the_fish met a beautiful little golden fish that swept his fins, he aproached the fish and the fish gave him a little smile,
time passed by and the golden fish started to lose interest, noticing this blob_the_fish freaked out and got confused, on the one hand he really likes the golden fish but on the other he knows that he is 
better off just moving on as he can not do anything about it, but the golden fish liked the atention and didnt want it to go away, so she kept sending the poor ugly blob_the_fish mixed messages, by now blob_the_fish was already
messed up due to the pressure change of the water as he had to go out of his comfort zone for her.
